what is spring framework

it is set of libraries.

before it was spring -> spring mvc -> spring boot -> spring boot 2.x

what is jvm architecture
java virtual machine
java is platform independent coding language true at certain extent
whenever we write code it goes in .java ->.class->bytecode it excute on jvm
we have install jvm to run that byte code
anything which is in jvm is supported by spring
like java kotlin

jdk->jvm->jre
-------------------------------------------------
Rest api and http

MVC architecture
before people use to develop web application in java
then it comes java EE
java EE had serverlet
and jdbc
serverlet creates routing for apis it is con
jdbc java database connection connect java application to data base
jdbc evolve to hibernate ->it evolve to spring data jpa
jpa java persistence api
-------------------------------------------------
now in application we have 3 component
front end -> back end-> data base
all connect each other

monolith one big combined application where a single code base
contain both backend and front end it was era of jsp serverlet
jsp - java server pages
mvc model view controller
single code base contain schema ui and back end
we had web inf ->xml -> .jsp pages
mvc architecture is not followed any more
-------------------------------------------------
code flow and structure
we will divide code in certain pattern
controller
service
repository
model
exception
etc

controller contain api these are first point of contatct
for any application no buisness logic inside
it wont talk to data base
they will majorly handle validation input data data cleanup d
authorization authentication
any idea of data cleanup

service layer it will contain all business logic
it will also wont talk to data base

repository or dao this layer talk to db it does not contain any business logic
------------------------------------------------
DI dependency injection and IOC container
** constructor is used to create a object while injecting something inside it
IOC inversion of control
As a developer i have full control on my code but spring takes the control
of dependency from developer that is inversion of control

there is something called ioc container where spring makes the object ready for use
@Repository
@autowired
@RestController

So whenever the application start spring crates the object for all annotated class
and store them in ioc container

@Autowired this tells the application to required object
according to autowire spring do dependency injection

what is ioc container it is space allotted for object that is created and
will be use later when needed by autowired
---------------------------------------------------
@Component marks class for object creation(object of these classes once created
and stored for use in ioc container)
@Repository same work but user readability
