AWS - core is pay per use and availability when needed for autoscaling

Server any thing like laptop machine but difference is normal server is made for only running our code
or we can sey anything which run our code is server.

Auto Scaling increase server and decrease server on demand automatically
pay for what you use
they introduced EC2 or ECC elastic compute cloud
we also need storage data base they build
RDS relational data base storage for sql
DynamoDB for no-sql

create AWS account and RDS account
check for any db instances running or not
search option create data base.

Show only versions that support the Multi-AZ DB cluster
here az means availability zone. it will present in different availability zone or on single place
this is not backup this is just duplicate data. its like we have distributed data in different zone for lesser geographical distance
data base have engine that is different version they execute query what we write
-------------------------------------------------------

Security Groups - if we have more than one part ec2 connected database we will not allow which ec2
call other db
for each instance/product i aws
i/p input for inbound traffic and
o/p output for outbound traffic
I can create different security group(collection of rule ) and associate them with
specific instance and specific product. no need to duplicate that again again

-------------------------------------------------------
after setting the RDS we copy we created the database in intellij
and after changing the value of application properties data base got created in rds but
we can not see any data base in rds for that we have to connect that data base somewhere like
intellij or dbver
