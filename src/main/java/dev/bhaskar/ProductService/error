Error
** these error code is sent by dispatcher serverlet that we have tpo handle
with our code if we want to change those error code.

There are types of error code we get
1 the one starting with 2 ex 200 201 202
these are success code
2 one that start with 4 ex 404 401
these are error stating that user have passed or requested bad
known as bad request
3 onr that start with 5 ex 501 500
these are known as server error
error with our code base or in server

so if client sending some bad request like -1 as id
if we directly dont handle the error it will 200 success with blank
if we handle in controller with illegal argument then it will give 500 as server error
but as this error is not related to our server its the bad request from the user
we have to handle this error solely and change the return code from 500 to 40x or 404 as bad request
